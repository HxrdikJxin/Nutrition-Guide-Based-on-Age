# 📄 Statement of the Project 
## 🌳 **Nutrition Guide Based on Age**

---

## 🔍 **Problem Statement**

People across different age groups have varying nutritional needs.  
However, most individuals, especially children, teenagers, and the elderly are unaware of the type of diet that best suits their age.  
Lack of awareness often leads to unhealthy eating habits, nutritional deficiencies, and long-term health issues.

To address this, a simple, accessible, and age-specific nutrition recommendation system is needed.  
This project solves the problem by accepting the user's age and displaying a list of foods suitable for that specific age category.

## 🎯 **Scope of the Project**

The scope of this project includes:

- Creating a simple, interactive Python program that classifies age into predefined groups.
- Providing clear, beginner-friendly nutritional suggestions for each age group.
- Handling invalid inputs and guiding the user to provide correct information.
- Offering basic documentation and structured output that can be used for academic purposes.
- Serving as a foundation for more advanced nutrition or health-based applications in future enhancements.

The project is **educational, modular, and easily extendable**, making it suitable for academic submissions and demonstrations.
